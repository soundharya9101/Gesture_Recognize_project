Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. 
You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote. 


The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie

For analysing videos using neural networks, two types of architectures are used commonly. 
One is the standard CNN + RNN architecture in which you pass the images of a video 
through a CNN which extracts a feature vector for each image, and then pass the sequence of these feature vectors through an RNN
The other popular architecture used to process videos is a natural extension of CNNs - a 3D convolutional network.
